Queen's Demise

This is a 2D Link to the Past-esque game made using Python 3.2.5 and pygame 1.9.2 

I made this for a game development class project over a 2ish month period. Most assets in the game (all sound/music, most sprites/art) were
used from open asset websites, namely Kenney.nl and OpenGameArt.org.

Full attributions are in the Attributions.txt file; thank you to all the artists who made this game possible.
